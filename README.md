# The Open MSCS ðŸŽ“

The open source compendium of graduate computer science course notes.

I built Open MSCS to house and share my course notes, study tips, and resources for OMSCS. You can browse and easily search the site at <https://openmscs.com/>.

## Getting Started

The site is built from the Markdown files under `docs/` using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/victoriadrake/open-mscs.git
   ```

2. Optionally, [create your virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).
3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pipenv install
   pre-commit install
   ```

Open the `docs/` folder in your favorite editor. You're ready to add or update notes!

### Local Development

You can run the local development server with `mkdocs serve`. Read the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for more options.

## Contributing
